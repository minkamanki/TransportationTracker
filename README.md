# TransportationTracker

This is a technology stack comparison project. We will compare the performance and functionality of this application with a similar app built using the Bun technology stack.In this version, we have implemented the application using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. 

The project includes a user authentication system, allowing users to log in and save their transportation data to the application. The app will calculate and analyze the total CO2 emissions generated by users' transportation choices.
